<p class="desc_p_1">Do you suffer from decreased visibility at night and in wet weather due to foggy, discolored headlights? <em>Restore your head lamps to their original luster!</em> The discoloration of your head lamps is caused by natural oxidation with the air outside. This combined with the road and environmental pollutants they face head-on, results in discolored and scratched head lamps and weaker, yellowish beams of light.</p>
<p class="desc_p_2 border_2">Restoring your head lamps is an effective, step-by-step process:</p>
<ul class="desc_list gradiant_2 border_2">
	<li class="desc_li">The exposed top layers of plastic are gently stripped away using special chemicals and a buffer.</li>
	<li class="desc_li">A coating of UV protectent is then applied in order to shield the newly restored headlights from the sun.</li>
	<li class="desc_li">The delicate process can be completed in as little as 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
