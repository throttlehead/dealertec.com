<h1 class="desc_h1 border_2">Windshield Repair</h1>
<p class="desc_p_1">If you've got a crack or chip in your windshield smaller than the size of a dollar, <em>save money by repairing it instead of replacing!</em> The front windshield is designed to keep your driver compartment intact while cushioning the air bag on deployment. For this reason, simply repairing the chip is sometimes the best choice, as replacing your windshield breaks the original factory seal, increasing the risk of a malfunction in the event of an accident.</p>
<p class="desc_p_2 border_2">Repairing your windshield is safe and effective:</p>
<ul class="desc_list gradiant_2 border_2">
	<li class="desc_li">All it takes is a small injection of resin to fill the damage in your glass.</li>

	<li class="desc_li">Repairs average about 20 minutes and can be done whether youâ€™re at home or work.</li>
</ul>
