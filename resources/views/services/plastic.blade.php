<p class="desc_p_1">Do you keep your car cleaned and waxed regularly, making sure it shines from top-to-bottom, but that plastic trim and molding just sits there burnt and discolored? <em>Re-dye it and re-seal it to it's original condition!</em> Over those long summer days, the sun's rays heat up and damage exterior plastics, leaving them looking gray and distorted. Our plastics restoration service gets all exterior plastic looking like new again.</p>
<p class="desc_p_2 border_2">Restoring your trim and molding is a simple, step-by-step process:</p>
<ul class="desc_list gradiant_2 border_2">
	<li class="desc_li">A solvent is used to clean & prep the plastic surface.</li>
	<li class="desc_li">The plastic is then re-dyed to it's original color.</li>
	<li class="desc_li">Finally, a coating of UV protectent is then applied in order to shield the newly restored headlights from future sun damage.</li>
</ul>
